## Summary
Each student should end this course with the following:


- Solid understanding of the HTML syntax behind webpages
- Solid understanding of CSS selectors, styles, and the box model
- Concepts behind modern web development layouts, such as grids and responsive design
- General understanding of how web pages appear by search engines and social networks
- Use HTML/CSS to make a webpage in a hosted web environment

I will also do my best to share the contextual relationship between this knowledge and modern software.

Each class will be focused on answering a question about HTML/CSS. By the end of each class, you should comfortably be able to answer the question to others.

## Assignments

- Final Assignment: Make a web site
