## Class 2

### Question
How does CSS work (selectors, weight)? What is the box model? How does CSS positioning work?

### Process
Review file structure. Review modern CSS (link file, CSS2, CSS3, email, browser quirks). Review selector weights and styles. Go over positioning and display. Review basic font qualities (serif/san-serif, weights, style, decoration). Review differences in image type (jpg, png, gif). Review pseudo-elements (:hover, :before, :after, :content).
