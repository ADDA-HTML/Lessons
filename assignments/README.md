# How to

- 1. Click "Create new file" to submit your homework.

- 2. If this is your first submission, make a folder with your first and last name. To do this, type your name in the text box above and add a `/` afterwards.

- 3. Otherwise, put your assignments in a folder based on the class number. Ie. `class1/`, `class/1`. 

- 4. Submit your homework by creating a file that corresponds with your assignment. Most assignments will be called `index.html`.
