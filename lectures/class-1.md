### Assignment
Make a travel wish list. The webpage should use the proper HTML syntax we reviewed in class. The webpage should have at least three cities. Each list item should have a sub header, an image, and a link to the wikipedia page of the city.

1. Make sure you have your index.html file saved.
2. Create three new files named after your three locations. (ie. peru.html, iceland.html, capetown.html)
3. Add content about the city in each file. Make sure to have a header, image and paragraph tag in each of the files.
4. Go back to your index.html file. Remove the links to wikipedia. Create links to each of the other _files_ that you created.
